## 🔍 Security Practices

CheckCle follows these practices to improve overall security:

- 🔎 Regular vulnerability scanning (npm audit for JavaScript dependencies, govulncheck for Go modules)
- ⛓️ Dependency pinning (package-lock.json and Go modules)
- ✅ Type-safe code in TypeScript and memory-safe design in Go
- 🧪 Continuous testing and CI pipelines
- 🔐 No data is stored or transmitted unless explicitly configured by the user
- 🧑‍💻 All code contributions are reviewed before merging

---

## ⚠️ Known Security Limitations

- Outbound HTTPS requests: CheckCle agents perform outbound HTTPS connections to send metric data to the backend server. Avoid deploying in untrusted or high-risk environments without appropriate network policies and monitoring.
- The data may be lost upon system restarts or crashes. Always ensure that backup (pb_data) and recovery mechanisms are in place in production environments.
